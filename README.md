# TA Projects
I volunteer tutor Calc 1-3 &amp; Diff-Eq/Linear at UNC Chapel Hill. I use real-world examples to show students that what they do can be implemented into scenarios they are interest in.

Much of this code is taken from my "TA Review Sessions" where I sit down in a classroom for 2-3 hours, write a problem on the board, and try to solve the problem with the tutees - first, without code/engineering, then, with an engineered solution and how we can implement it into production. 

I use a lot of different programming languages. I do this so I can learn more of the language myself. Due to the interest in the quantitative finance field, I mainly use cpp/ocaml/rust, but I like to switch it up.
