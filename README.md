# TA Projects

These are projects from my TA reviews. Each file has a rundown of what's going on- detailed with the problem statement and my solution that we developed in class. There is likely more than one solution!! If you have questions, don't hesitate to text or email me. 

For students who are more eager on applications, we have some challenge "beyond calc" problems from Jane Street's challenge repository (https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/index.html) in the non-calc problems folder. 

Most secondary resources are available on Canvas. 

## Overview 
As a volunteer tutor for Calculus I-III at UNC Chapel Hill, I use real-world examples to demonstrate the practical applications of mathematical concepts to my students.

My approach involves conducting "TA Review Sessions," where I present a problem and guide tutees through solving it conceptually before implementing an engineered solution.

This method bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. To enhance my own skills and cater to students interested in quantitative finance, I utilize a diverse range of programming languages, primarily C++, OCaml, and Rust, while also exploring others. This multifaceted approach not only aids in students' comprehension but also keeps me at the forefront of various programming paradigms, ensuring that I can provide relevant and industry-aligned guidance. 

## Other Resources

- 3Blue1Brown (https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown/playlists)
Specifically, I recommend his Essence of Calculus playlist. He presents Calculus in a very visually stimulating way that makes it coherent.

- Schloeglâ€™s book Quantitative Finance, an Object-Oriented Approach in C++ (or really any financial mathematics book)
