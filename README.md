# TA Projects
As a volunteer tutor for Calculus I-III at UNC Chapel Hill, I use real-world examples to demonstrate the practical applications of mathematical concepts to my students.

My approach involves conducting "TA Review Sessions," where I present a problem and guide tutees through solving it conceptually before implementing an engineered solution.

This method bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation. To enhance my own skills and cater to students interested in quantitative finance, I utilize a diverse range of programming languages, primarily C++, OCaml, and Rust, while also exploring others. This multifaceted approach not only aids in students' comprehension but also keeps me at the forefront of various programming paradigms, ensuring that I can provide relevant and industry-aligned guidance.
